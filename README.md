### Introduction
This project analyzes air quality data in Nairobi to understand pollution levels, trends, and spatial patterns. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature extraction, and visualization techniques such as histograms, line charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps. And this is what I did: cleaned the dataset, extracted key features like PM2.5, PM10, and CO concentrations, explored distributions and summary statistics, visualized temporal and spatial trends, and calculated correlations to understand relationships between different pollutants.

*Import libraries*

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.express as px
```

## Conclusion
The air quality analysis in Nairobi reveals patterns in pollution levels across different regions and time periods. Trends and correlations between pollutants provide insights into environmental and health impacts, while visualizations highlight areas of high concern. Overall, the project demonstrates how data science can support monitoring, understanding, and mitigating air pollution effectively.
